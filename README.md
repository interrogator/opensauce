#\#OpenSauce

> At the first ever Research Bazaar, in Melbourne, 2015, delegates from around the world convened in order to teach and learn open-source digital research tools.

> The event was a resounding success, with many future interdisciplinary colloborations planned. Key to its success was the daily provision of breakfasts, lunches, and sometimes, dinners. Despite attendee pleas, our fearless chef, *Nic*, refused to divulge her secret recipes.

> From passion for Open Knowledge and a shitty pun, *opensauce* was born.

## To build

If you want a nicely formatted, bleeding-edge version of the book, clone the repository and use your TeX builder to compile `sauce_book.tex`. If that's too much effort, a fairly recent PDF version will be kept [here](https://github.com/interrogator/opensauce/blob/master/sauce_book.pdf).

## To contribute

The easiest way is to make a pull request. Ideally, you'll want to create a LaTeX formatted file in `recipes/` that follows the syntax of existing entries (e.g. [`recipes/mango_curry.tex`](https://github.com/interrogator/opensauce/blob/master/recipes/mango_curry.tex)). Please feel free to add your name and affiliation to any contribution you make.

Upon compile, our main `sauce_book.tex` file will include all recipes included in `recipes/`.

If you want to add an image, it can be stored in `images/`. In line with the zen of TeX and open-source, make sure it's pretty and yours.

## Where to from here?

Other pun-based project ideas are more than welcome. Monty Python humour is the sole exception.

Otherwise, you could always return to your thesis.
